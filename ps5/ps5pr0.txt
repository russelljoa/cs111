Grace Murray Hopper was instrumental to opening new worlds in computing because of her vision of accessibility. I really love the way her concept for computer interfaces being programmer-friendly and user-friendly sounds, and I think many mainstream softwares and applications follow this format today. Sites like X or instagram are all user friendly, but have extensive back end APIs so people can build on them as well. Additionally, her business-oriented programming using mainly english words was very smart, as we see that in many programming languages toady. Python is the best example of this in my opinion, because many basic scripts almost read out the way they run, which I think is very good for new coders.
